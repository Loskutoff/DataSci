How do we measure how smart, happy, or healthy someone is? How powerful, free, or secure a country is? Once we get that data, we want to use data science to figure out whether this stuff changes, improves, differs across people, or predicts some future outcome, and much more.\n\nBut it all starts with figuring out measurement -- how would we know how much of something exists? How would we know how that thing varies across people, animals, families, companies, countries?\n \nLet’s start by measuring something easy. The distance traveled by gummy bears! We’ll build some catapults, launch some gummy bears, and measure how far they flew!\n"
