It's kind of like a word document but there is one important difference: you can write and run code right in a Jupyter Notebook (JNB for short). When you run the code, the output will be inserted directly right below the code.\n\n- **A notebook consists of a series of CELLS.** There are two main types of cells: a *Markdown* cell, which is used for entering text; and a *Code* cell, which is used for entering R code. (We have over-simplified a bit here, but this is enough to get you started.) The text you are reading now is inside of a *Markdown* cell. A little further down the page we will show you some *Code* cells.\n\n- **A notebook is a great way to organize, present, and share a data analysis.** The notebook format fits well with the practice of data analysis. In a *markdown* cell you can pose questions and then propose a data analysis plan. You can then add a *code* cell to write R code and actually run the analyses you want to run. After you run an analysis, you can add another *markdown* cell to interpret the results of the analysis you ran.\n"

This means that if you share your notebook with someone else, if they run your notebook top to bottom they will get the same results that you got. This is a great way to share your work, have other people check out your work, and let you know if you made any mistakes. It also gives them a way to fix your mistakes, and send you back the fix!\n\nAn important thing to remember is that notebooks, to be reproducible, often need to be run in order from the top. Sometimes, if you start re-running things from the middle, it messes things up, not the least of which is your thinking!\n\nLet's try an example. Let's say that we want to measure the length of a newborn baby and save the result in an R object called **length**. The baby was 2 feet long. Run the code below to store 2 (feet) into **length**.\n"

For example, you can add Markdown cells for your own notes or answers; you can write some answers right below questions; you can use comments (that start with #) within code cells to annotate your answers. If any questions come up that you want to ask later, you can write those questions in as well! \n\nAnd finally, when you exit, *be sure to Close and Halt* the notebook instead of just closing the browser. This will ensure that you do not run out of memory. If too many people forget to do this, these jupyter notebooks will be slow for everyone!\n\nTo close a notebook, go to **File -> Close and Halt**. \n\nMaybe say to yourself, **Don't be at fault, CLOSE and HALT!**"
