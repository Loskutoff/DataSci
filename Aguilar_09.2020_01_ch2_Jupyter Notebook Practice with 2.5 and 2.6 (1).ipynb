The terms statistic and parameter are used to distinguish between cases in which we have data for a sample, and cases in which we have data for an entire population.**\n\nHow do we select a sample?  Fill in the blanks to address that!\n\nMost of the data sets we will be working with assume that our sample is independently and randomly chosen from the population.\n\nFor a sample to be ___________, every object in the population must have an equal probability of being selected for the study.  While it may be difficult to select a sample that is truly random, we try our best to obtain a sample that is representative of the population we are trying to learn about.\n\n_______________ means that the selection of one object for a study has no effect on the selection of another object.  This is important because if two objects are not independent, and instead are similar to each other on whatever outcome variable we might be studying, then this could lead us to draw erroneous conclusions from our data.\n\nSampling Variation:\n\nEvery sample we take, especially if they are small samples, will vary – which means the samples will be different from one another.  Further, no sample will be perfectly representative of the population.  \n\nThis type of variation is called _______________ or _______________, and it can be either biased or unbiased.\n\n\n"
